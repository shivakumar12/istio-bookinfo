Subject: New SonarQube Code Metrics Threshold Notifications in Our Jenkins Pipeline

Dear [Lead's Name or Team],

I hope this message finds you well. We're excited to share a significant improvement in our Jenkins build pipeline - the incorporation of SonarQube code metrics thresholds, complete with sample email notifications to illustrate how it works.

**What's New:**

We've recently introduced a new stage in our pipeline that integrates SonarQube code analysis, with a focus on lines of code and newline metrics thresholds. This change is designed to uphold our code quality standards and ensure that our software development process remains efficient and effective.

**Sample Notification Email:**

Below, you'll find a sample email notification that demonstrates how the system works:

```
Subject: Code Quality Threshold Alert

Action Required: We need to review and optimize the code to meet our code quality standards.

Please review the code changes and coordinate with the development team to address this issue promptly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
