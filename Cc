To implement a code coverage API plugin in a declarative Jenkins pipeline, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Plugins:**
   Make sure you have the necessary plugins installed in your Jenkins instance to support code coverage reporting. Popular plugins for code coverage include JaCoCo, Cobertura, or other relevant plugins based on your technology stack.

2. **Configure Your Build Environment:**
   Set up your build environment with the necessary tools for building, testing, and generating code coverage reports. This might involve specifying your programming language, test framework, and other dependencies.

3. **Configure Declarative Pipeline:**
   In your Jenkinsfile, define the declarative pipeline stages and steps for your build process. This includes checking out the code, building, testing, and generating code coverage reports.

4. **Integrate Code Coverage Reporting:**
   Use the appropriate plugin commands or scripts to generate the code coverage report during the testing stage. Depending on the plugin you're using, the specific command or script will vary. Below is a general example for using the JaCoCo plugin:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout your code repository here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build your code here
            }
        }
        
        stage('Run Tests') {
            steps {
                // Run your tests here
                
                // Generate code coverage report using JaCoCo
                sh 'mvn clean test jacoco:report'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Publish Coverage') {
            steps {
                // Archive and publish the code coverage report
                publishHTML([
                    allowMissing: false,
                    alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
                    keepAll: true,
                    reportDir: '**/target/site/jacoco',
                    reportFiles: 'index.html',
                    reportName: 'Code Coverage Report'
                ])
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, replace `'mvn clean test jacoco:report'` with the appropriate command for generating code coverage reports based on your technology stack and the plugin you are using.

5. **Trigger and Build:**
   Commit your Jenkinsfile to your version control repository. Afterward, trigger a pipeline build in Jenkins. The pipeline will execute the defined stages, including generating and publishing the code coverage report.

Remember to tailor the pipeline stages and steps to your specific project's needs and the code coverage plugin you're using. Each plugin might have its own configuration and reporting requirements.
