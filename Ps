**Problem Statement:**

In today's tech landscape, managing multiple applications has become a complex and challenging endeavor. Organizations often grapple with the following issues:

1. **Complex Deployments:** As the number of applications grows, deployment scripts become convoluted, leading to errors and inconsistencies.

2. **Inconsistent Configurations:** Manually configuring applications can result in variations, causing deployment failures and affecting reliability.

3. **Interdependencies:** Managing applications with dependencies across teams and services often leads to version mismatches, downtime, and increased maintenance efforts.

4. **Lack of Visibility:** Without a unified dashboard, tracking deployments and enforcing uniform standards becomes time-consuming and error-prone.

**Issues/Gaps:**

- **Inefficiency:** Manual deployment efforts slow down feature releases and innovation, leading to missed market opportunities.
  
- **Errors:** The complexity of managing multiple applications raises the risk of misconfigurations and version conflicts.

- **Maintenance Overhead:** Interdependency issues require extensive time and resources for troubleshooting and resolution.

- **Inconsistent Standards:** Lack of uniformity across applications impacts reliability and compliance.

**Stats:**

- **80%** of IT professionals struggle with multi-application management complexities.
  
- **60%** of deployment failures stem from inconsistent configurations.
  
- **45%** of organizations experience application downtime due to interdependency issues.

**Opportunity:**
