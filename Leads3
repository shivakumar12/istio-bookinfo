Subject: Important Update: Implementing Code Quality Thresholds in Our Jenkins Pipeline

Dear [Lead's Name or Team],

I hope this message finds you well. We have some exciting news to share with you regarding a pivotal improvement in our Jenkins build pipeline.

We have recently integrated a new stage in our pipeline that focuses on SonarQube lines of code metrics with an added emphasis on code quality thresholds. This strategic enhancement is designed to ensure that our codebase consistently meets predefined quality standards, and it represents a significant step towards optimizing our development practices.

Here's an overview of what this incorporation entails:

- **Lines of Code (LoC) Metrics:** We are now actively tracking LoC metrics with defined thresholds. This will allow us to measure and control the size and complexity of our codebase in a more precise manner.

- **Code Duplication:** The new system includes thresholds for code duplication checks, enabling us to efficiently manage and minimize duplications.

- **Code Complexity:** We are setting and monitoring thresholds for code complexity to ensure that our code remains maintainable and comprehensible.

- **Code Coverage:** Our pipeline will now assess code coverage against predefined thresholds, ensuring that we maintain the desired level of test coverage.

This upgrade empowers us to take proactive steps to ensure code quality aligns with our standards and goals. It provides us with the means to enforce best practices and continuously elevate our software development process.

We welcome any questions, require further information, or are open to discussing the inner workings of this new threshold system. Your input and insights are invaluable to us as we collectively strive for excellence.

We appreciate your leadership and continued support in our mission to deliver high-quality software.

Best regards,
